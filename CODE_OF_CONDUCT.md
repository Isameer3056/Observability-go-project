## 📜 `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

```markdown
# 🌍 Code of Conduct

This project is meant to be a **safe, inclusive, and welcoming space** for anyone curious about observability and SRE practices.  
I want people (including myself) to feel comfortable learning, experimenting, and sharing ideas here.

---

## 🚦 The Quick Version

- Be kind.  
- Be respectful.  
- No harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.  
- Assume good intentions — we’re all learning.  
- If you disagree, debate ideas, not people.  

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The Longer Version

We come from different backgrounds, skill levels, and cultures. That’s the beauty of open source.  
This project should be a place where you can ask “naive” questions without fear, and where feedback is given constructively.  

If something makes you feel uncomfortable, please let me know via GitHub Issues.

## 🛡 Enforcement

I (Sameer Imtiaz, project maintainer) will review reports of misconduct and may remove comments, issues, or contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.  

Let’s keep this repo a place to **learn, share, and grow together**.
