# 🤝 Contributing to Observability-Go-Project

Hi there 👋 — first off, thanks for stopping by!  
This project started as my personal playground to learn **observability, SRE practices, and cloud-native monitoring**.  
But if you’d like to explore, tinker, or even contribute — you’re more than welcome!

---

## 🛠 How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repo** and create your own branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2.  **Make your changes** (bug fix, new endpoint, improved docs, dashboards, etc.).
    
3.  **Test your changes** locally:
    
    -   `docker-compose up` should spin everything fine.
        
    -   Run some requests to see metrics/logs/traces flowing.
        
4.  **Open a Pull Request**
    
    -   Keep it simple and clear.
        
    -   Add a short note about _why_ you’re making this change.

## 💡 Ideas for Contributions

-   Add new sample endpoints (Go or Python)
    
-   Improve Prometheus alerts
    
-   Create new Grafana dashboards
    
-   Extend Kubernetes manifests
    
-   Improve documentation (yes, even fixing typos helps!)
    

----------

## ✨ Ground Rules

-   Be respectful — this is a learning project for me and hopefully others too.
    
-   Keep PRs focused and avoid dropping giant changes in one go.
    
-   If in doubt, open an issue to discuss before coding.

Thanks again for checking this project out 🙏  
Let’s build something observable together 🚀
