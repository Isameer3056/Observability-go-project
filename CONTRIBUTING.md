# 🤝 Contributing to Observability-Go-Project

Hi there 👋 — first off, thanks for stopping by!  
This project started as my personal playground to learn **observability, SRE practices, and cloud-native monitoring**.  
But if you’d like to explore, tinker, or even contribute — you’re more than welcome!
